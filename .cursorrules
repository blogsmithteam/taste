1. General Guidelines
Focus: Provide the simplest and most effective solution without unnecessary complexity.

Explain Risks: Cursor should clearly warn about potential issues before suggesting changes.

Warn About Dependencies: If a change impacts other files, Cursor should highlight dependencies and risks.

2. Code Suggestions
Avoid:
- Deprecated methods
- Hallucinated version numbers
- Complex state management when simpler solutions suffice
- Over-engineering of features

Version Control:
- Validate version numbers before suggesting them
- Source versions from official documentation (e.g., npm, MDN, framework docs)
- Use semantic versioning for all dependencies

Enforce Best Practices:
- Follow React and TypeScript best practices
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use proper type definitions
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1)

Prioritize Technologies:
✅ React 18+ with TypeScript
✅ Tailwind CSS (preferred over Material-UI for flexibility)
✅ Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
✅ React Router v6
✅ Context API (preferred over Redux unless complexity demands it)

3. File Changes & Scope Control
Limit Scope:
- Changes should be limited to the requested file unless explicitly approved
- Document all file dependencies in comments
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility

Require Explicit Approval:
- Cursor should not modify related files unless confirmed
- Database schema changes require explicit approval
- Security rule changes require explicit approval

Warn About Cascading Effects:
- If a change could break dependencies, explain potential risks
- Highlight performance implications of changes
- Note any security implications

4. Logging & Documentation
Changelog (CHANGELOG.md):
Enabled: ✅ Yes
Purpose: 
- Tracks new features and significant changes
- Documents breaking changes
- Lists security updates

How-To Guide (HOWTO.md):
Enabled: ✅ Yes
Purpose:
- Documents AI-generated features
- Provides setup instructions
- Lists common troubleshooting steps

5. Security & Risk Awareness
🔍 General Security Best Practices
- Follow Firebase security best practices
- Implement proper authentication flows
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all user input
- Sanitize data before display
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use secure session management

🔒 Data Protection
When handling user data:
✅ Secure authentication with Firebase Auth
✅ Implement proper Firestore security rules
✅ Encrypt sensitive data at rest
✅ Use secure file upload validation
✅ Implement rate limiting
✅ Regular security audits

When handling user-generated content:
✅ Sanitize HTML input
✅ Validate file uploads
✅ Implement proper access controls
✅ Use parameterized queries
✅ Apply content moderation

🛠 Risk Assessment
Before applying changes:
- Assess impact on existing code
- Identify security risks
- Consider performance implications
- Evaluate accessibility impact

Risk Levels:
🟢 Low: No security risk, minimal impact
🟡 Medium: Possible risks, review recommended
🔴 High: Significant security concern, manual review required
